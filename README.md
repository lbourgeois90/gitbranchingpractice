# gitbranchingpractice

This is a project to practice branching with git.

Some branching commands

- `git branch` -- shows you the branches and which one you are one
- `git branch <branch-name>`-- creates a branch called <branch-name> AKA whaever you wanna name the branch
- `git checkout` --checks out the branch called branch-name
  - `git push remote-name branch-name`  --pushes code from branch-name to the remote remote-name (usually origin)
